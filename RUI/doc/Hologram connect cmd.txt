1.ATI											//query firmware of NB-IOT chip
2.AT+COPS=?										//search operator net, it will cost at least 30s
3.AT+COPS=1,0,"CHINA MOBILE",0					//register to your operator, query your operator whether supports hologram or not
4.AT+CREG?										//Check whether the device is registered on the network
5.AT+QNWINFO                       				// Query connected network information
6.AT+COPS?   									// Query the connected web server information
7.AT+QICSGP=1,1,"hologram","","",1      		// Set APN network to hologram
8.AT+QIACT=1 									// Activate the APN network
9.AT+QIACT? 									// Query the APN assigned IP address
10.AT+QIOPEN=1,0,"TCP","cloudsocket.hologram.io",9999,0,1   // Create a TCP, connection hologram test server
11.AT+QISEND=0,48								// Send data, send data length is 48
12.{"k":"bZmmdbAg","d":"Hello,World!","t":"TOPIC1"} //Send Packets.The data format is a hologram-defined

be replaced with your card device key.
13.AT+QISEND=0,0 								// Query data is sent successfully
14.AT+QICLOSE=0									//close tcp link


Notes:
All cmd will responce once in RTT log viewer, except below:
1. AT+QIOPEN=1,0,"TCP","cloudsocket.hologram.io",9999,0,1
   this cmd will responce twice, so send next after recieving two responces.
2. AT+QISEND=0,48	
   after send this, no responce, just send next directly.
  

If send failed, repeat from 10. More details is in RUI With Hologram.io V1.0.
Ble tool is recommended to use nnRF Connect by nordic.
